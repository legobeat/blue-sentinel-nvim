COMMANDS                                *blue_sentinel-commands*

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelStartServer*
 :BlueSentinelStartServer {host} {port}
                        Start the built-in server. Optionnally you can specify
                        the {host} and {port}. By default the server will
                        start on 127.0.0.1 on port 8080.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelStopServer*
 :BlueSentinelStopServer     Stop the built-in server along with all its 
                        connections.
                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelStartSingle*
 :BlueSentinelStartSingle {host} {port}
                        Join the server. The first client to connect should
                        use this command. Subsequent clients should use
                        |:BlueSentinelJoinSingle|. This avoids unfortunate
                        buffer overwriting. It only shares the current buffer.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelJoinSingle*
 :BlueSentinelJoinSingle {host} {port}
                        Like |:BlueSentinelStartSingle| to join the server if there
                        are already connected client(s).

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelStatus*
 :BlueSentinelStatus         Show the connection status.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelFollow*
 :BlueSentinelFollow {username}
                        Follow a user modifications specified by its
                        {username}. To stop following use |:BlueSentinelStopFollow|

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelStopFollow*
 :BlueSentinelStopFollow     Stop following a user.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelStartSession*
 :BlueSentinelStartSession {host} {port}
                        Similar to |:BlueSentinelStartSingle| except it shares all
                        buffers and newly opened buffers.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelJoinSession*
 :BlueSentinelJoinSession {host} {port}
                        Join a session started with |:BlueSentinelStartSession| by 
                        a another client.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelMark*
 :BlueSentinelMark           Mark a visually selected region. It sends the
                        mark to other connected clients. If there are 
                        following clients , they will be transported to 
                        the mark.  It is useful to point out code regions 
                        to other clients.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelMarkClear*
 :BlueSentinelMarkClear      Clears all marks.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelOpenAll*
 :BlueSentinelOpenAll        Open all files in the current working directory. This
                        can be used with |:BlueSentinelStartSingle| to share the
                        whole directory.

                                        *blue_sentinel-:BlueSentinelSaveAll*
 :BlueSentinelSaveAll        Save all opened buffers. Unlike |:wall|, it also
                        creates missing subdirectories.
